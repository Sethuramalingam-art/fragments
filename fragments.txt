The div element has more methods and properties, which causes it to consume more memory which can make the page slow load time; 
the prototype chain is like HTMLDivElement -> HTMLElement -> Element -> Node -> EventTarget, whereas the React fragment has fewer methods with 
the prototype chain DocumentFragment -> Node -> EventTarget.
